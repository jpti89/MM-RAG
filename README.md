# Multi-Modal Retrieval Augmented Generation

This Project explores the following:

- Creating a RAG Pipeline Using Mistral 7B and Chroma DB.
- Exploring and performing assessments on recent state-of-the-art MM-RAGs (Gemini, Claude AI, ChatGPT v4)
- Evaluating performance using metrics including quality, coherence, factual accuracy, computational efficiency, and context-awareness.

The project Google_Gemini_multimodal_rag_DEMO.ipynb provides a guide to building a document search engine using multimodal retrieval augmented generation (RAG), step by step:

1. Extracting and storing metadata of documents containing both text and images, and generate embeddings the documents
2. Using a text query as input, search for contexual answers using both text and images

## Installation 

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install required libraries mentioned in the jupyter notebooks.
